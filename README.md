# Algorithms for every programmer  
  
This is a repository with algorithms that every programmer should know/learn.  
  
**Sumary:**  
  
 - Dynamic Programming
 - Sort Algorithms
 - Search Algorithms
 - Greedy Algorithms
 - Recursive Algorithms


## Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming stores the result of sub-problems for re-computation, for future use. This simple optimization reduuces time complexities from exponential to polynomial time.

**Example:**

 - Fibonacci Number Series
 - Knapsack problem
 - Shortest Path by Dijkstra
 - Matrix Chain 
 

## Sort Algorithms

This is used to rearrange arrays or given list of elements according to a comparison operator function. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements.

**Example:**

 - Quick sort
 - Insertion Sort
 - Selection Sort
 - Bubble Sort
 - Radix Sort
 - Heap Sort

## Search Algorithms
Designed to retrieve information stored within a data strcture

**Example:**

 - Linear Search
 - Binary Search
 - Depth first Search
 - Breadth first Search

## Greedy Algorithms
An algorithms paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefits.

**Example**

 - Huffman Coding
 - Factional knapsack
 - Problem
 - Activity Selection
 - Job Sequencing Problem

## Recursive Algorithms
An algorithms which calls itself with smaller or simpler input values. The result is returned back up the chain of calls until it hits the original problem.

**Example**

 - Factorial Exponential
 - Tower of Hanoi
 - Tree Traversal


I'm making this repo available as a studying tool to help other developers.

If you think is a good idea to add more samples, let me know.
